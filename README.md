# Mask Coverage Detection

## Intuition: 

COVID-19 has recently become a global pandemic caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. In addition to maintaining a proper social distancing, use of face mask is a key measure in suppressing transmission and saving lives. As per WHO, a mask must cover nose, mouth and chin, however due to the limitation of resources, many people have resorted to the use of non-medical(fabric) masks which often creates breathability and fit issues leading to improper wear of masks - leaving their nose or mouth uncovered.  This increases the chance of infection especially in crowded settings.

Based on the latest statistics as on Jan 2020, there has been a total of 85.2M reported cases with an active death count of 1.84M. Thus in order to ensure proper use of mask in areas such as busy shopping centers, religious buildings, restaurants, schools and public transport, having an alerting system to alert whenever a person is not covering their nose or mouth will be of great help in curbing further community spread.
